SoCs and functional blocks : Instead of having different controllers for each peripherals the chip
designers have integrated all of them inside a single chip and the board designers can use them as
and when needed. It's documented in the technical reference manual.

SoCs can have mac layers which needs an external PHY chip to interface with the actual port. For
example ethernet mac in present in the SoC and need a chip to connect to RJ45 connector. The
communication bw soc and phy is based on standard protocols.

Linux Boot Requirements: 1. RBL : ROM Boot Loader - supplied by vendor, tiny, runs out of ROM and
loads the secondary bootloader(SPL-secondary program loader or MLO-memory loader) Its loaded onto
the ROM while taping out of the SoC. On power up, the SoC runs the RBL, which inits the stack and
runs the main() of RBL. It generally starts a watchdog timer, withon which it should be able to load
the SPL or else the timer expires and resets. After that it will init the PLLs to provide clocks to
core and memory peripherals and other important peripherals. One cannot change these settings at
this stage. The developer can alter this only when the SPL is executing. Then it searches for a
valid SPL image in the memory devices or bootable interfaces one by one. If found, it copies the SPL
to the internal ram and executes it. Or else the watchdog expires and resets the core. 

2. SPL - This loads and executes third stage bootloader like U-Boot. Initially resides on sd card or
external non volatile storage. Its copied by the RBL onto internal SRAM.Runs out of Internal SRAM.
MLO inits the processor to the point where the U-boot is copied to the external RAM or DDR memory.
It inits the UART for debug printf. It reconfigure the PLL to desired values for the application. It
inits the DDR memory registers to use the DDR memory. MLO does some mux config to bring out
bootloader interfaces to the pins. eg eMMC or sd card etc. Then it loads the U-boot image to DDR
memory and executes it(passes control to it). It cannot load to internal RAM as it is kb
range(small).  The reason that RBL cannot load the u-boot image directly to the ddr memory is
because the vendor doesnt know the kind of the dr memory used and cant provide same rom code for it.
It the the developer/designer that knows the kind of memory used and the fine params that must be
used to init it and hence this is done at MLO stage.

3.Third stage bootloader - Loads and executes Linux kernel. Runs out of DDR memory. This does lot of
hardware related inits(i2c,nand,flash,ethernet,uart,usb,mmc) as u-boot supports loading linux kernel
from all these peripherals. It then load the linux kernel from one of these boot sources to the ddr
memory and passes the boot arguments and to it. Lots of boot behaviour can be set using uEnv.txt
file. u-boot looks for uImage which is zImage(elf of linux kernel) + uBoot header and gets the
location of it using the uEnv.txt file. Its generally present in the rootfs/boot folder. Uboot
extract the info such as entry pint address/cpu arch etc from the u-boot image header and checks the
integrity with the checksums. Also does the same for the device tree binary. Strting kernel... is
where the control is handed over to the linux bootstrap loader from the u-boot bootloader. 

4. Linux bootstrap : misc.c takes care of uncompressing the linux kernel and executing it. There is
a kernel_entry() which jumps to the linux bootstrap code head.S along with flattended device tree
and decompresses the kernel using misc.c , boots it and runs the init. Now the head.S of kernel
runs, which is processor arch specific startup code(NOT Soc). It inits the vectors,page table inits
and mmu(for virtual memory) and calls the start_kernel() for booting the linux. Both of these head.S
is arch specific. Inside kernel's head.S, expected value : r0=0;r1=machine id;r2=atags or dtb
pointer and mmu is off at this stage and this is called from the bootstrap decompressing code ie.
head.S. It then calls the apt memory managemenet routines inside mm folder for initing the mmu for
virtual memory. Then start_kernel() is called from head_common.S which calls init/main.c(arch
independent code) of linux kernel

5.In init/main.c lots of kernel inits take place ie. timers, console, mmu and finally launches the
first user program ie. init. At the end of start_kernel(), it calls rest_init() which creates two
threads kernel_init(used to spawn init() and has pid of 1) and kthreadd(used to spawn other kernel
threads), after which it starts the scheduler and cpu goes to cpu idle loop. Inside kernel_init, it frees all the memory used by prev inits and it wont be called again. Init() inits the rootfs and things are ready to run.
